# Papyromancy
**Papyromancy:** A way of divination through folding paper. Some say a true papyromancer can crumple up any piece of paper, unfold it, and predict the future from the creased lines
reading the creased paper the way that a palm reader would read a person's palm.

When it comes to currency exchange, sometimes it seems the exchange rates are as ambiguous as a fortune teller.  The rates can be all over the 
board, and how do we know if we are getting a fair rate?  We've created an app that will give you the current exchange rate when exchanging American dollars to another currency.
We've also included a purchasing power parity that will give you a better idea of how far your dollar will go in those countries.  

## Pseudocode
Once we decided to make this app we started writing pseudocode to map out our plan of action.  Then we made a wireframe diagram to get an idea of how we wanted the 
app to present itself on a device.  Because the world is going mobile we wanted it to be an app that was mobile first.  We divided up tasks to start the project and 
got to work.

## Resources
We used 2 server side API's in our app.  A **[currency converter API](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/)**, and a **[purchasing power parity 
API](https://purchasing-power-parity.com/)**.  For the base framework and design of our app we used **[Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)**. To call the API's 
in our code we used **[Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)**.
